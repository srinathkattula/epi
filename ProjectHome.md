The Erlang Plus Interface library (EPI) is a tool set of C++ classes to easily build applications in C++ what comunicates with Erlang.
The intention of the library is to cover the holes that EI library offers:

  * An object oriented implementation
  * A simple API
  * Extensibility
  * Abstraction of comunication mechanism
  * Simplified management of incoming messages (mailboxes)
